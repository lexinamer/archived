        <p>For the past century, people have documented their lives through snapshots. Preserved in private albums and shoeboxes, these once cherished images have been discarded to the 25 cent bin at thrift stores. In its place are hastily taken family photos that are now posted on the Internet for all the world to see.</p>

        <p>But what if we took a deeper look at these photos?</p>

        <p>What could they show us about culture, about family, and about the way we preserve our history and tell our stories? </p>
