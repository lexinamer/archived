    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>For the past century, photo albums and shoe-boxes have been filled with snapshots, chronicling the history of families that were then passed on from generation to generation. These albums have preserved family genealogy through images, providing glimpses into the past not only concerning the legacy of family, but of culture.</p>

    <p>However, in the past decade, the shoe-boxes have been traded for pixels, the albums for Facebook, Instagram, and Flickr. Although family photographs were once carefully cared for and curated, often only viewed by a handful of people, today, these images can be accessed instantly and worldwide. Children now grow up with a detailed account of their entire lives, with every moment able to be liked and viewed by the masses.</p>

    <p>Family photography has been a prevalent part of society for preserving and recording history for the past century, and the digital era is disrupting that in ways that are still yet to be seen.</p>

    <p><em>Archived comes from that disruption.</em></p>

    <p>As photography and our entire way of documentation is undergoing rapid changes with the digital form, it is imperative that we begin to try and understand the ramifications that this new form is having. </p>

    <p>Over the past five months, I curated three collections of family photographs spanning the past 100 years of American history and looked at the similarities and themes throughout the images. <a href="albums.html">Click here to read more about the families and collections.</a></p>

    <p>The goal is this website is to allow people to explore the history of family photography. I hope that it highlights the importance of preserving and archiving personal materials, but also how identity and memory have been influenced by images over time.</p>

    <h1>About The Project</h1>
    <p>My name is Lexi Namer and I am a visual storyteller and interactive designer living in North Carolina. I am interested in the intersections of journalism, technology, and the digital humanities. While I come from a fine art and photography background, I now spends most of my time utilizing code and design to create beautiful things for the internet.</p>

    <p>This project was created as my master’s thesis in Visual Communication at the University of North Carolina’s School of Media and Journalism. </p>
